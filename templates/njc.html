<h1>Letter from Babacar</h1>
<p class = "w3-small">We all encompass so many causes to embrace and identities to claim. There are times we find ourselves torn in between identities that are privileged and underprivileged, a victim and a perpetrator. Am I a man in this patriarchal society, a griot in Senegal, or a black man in this global society? I tell my students on Bridge Year, there are at least four answers to any question. And there are many identities in all of us humans. I am a father, a brother, a friend, a husband, a host, a guest, a threat, an ally. I embrace this complexity that forms me, a human being. . .</p>
