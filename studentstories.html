"Why Senegal? I chose to go to Senegal with Bridge Year because I suspected that if I didn't go then, when it was being offered to me, I might never find myself in Senegal or even on the African continent at another time. The other BY country options for 2013-14 all seemed like places I might go on my own someday—English or Spanish-speaking places or common tourist destinations where I could likely navigate fairly easily (except China, but I did not feel very drawn to China at the time). Senegal, on the other hand, was a country I'd barely even heard of; so I made it my first choice. Now, Senegal is meaningful to me in ways I struggle to describe fully. My time there fundamentally changed the course of my personal development and my identity, both through immersion in Senegalese culture and through the very intentional progression and reflection included in our BY programming. Senegalese people are a consistent presence in my WhatsApp feeds, and I still talk to myself in Wolof sometimes. Yet one of my greatest regrets since Bridge Year has been the feeling of impotence that I can't "return the favor" to the many Senegalese people who have helped shape me; no matter how much money I send or gifts I bring when I visit, I can't offer them a visa to the US or a sponsored cultural immersion program in my own country. I continue to stay in touch with many people from my bridge year now, seven years later, hoping that someday at least one of them might come to stay in my home."

<p class = "w3-small w3-padding w3-teal">"Thanks to Babacar and countless other wonderful folks I met during Bridge Year, I spent the summer before my senior year in Senegal doing research for my thesis, which was by far the most formative experience - intellectually, spiritually, emotionally - that I have had at Princeton and in my life. I attribute absolutely all of my success with my thesis to the generosity, brilliance, and patience of the folks in Dakar and Dene who taught me and led me. There is no way I could ever repay or thank them enough - the wisdom, guidance, and love they gave me were absolutely monumental."

"The experience was and has been deeply transformative. My host-family opened their home to me with a warmth and hospitality previously inconceivable to me given the Senegalese value around communality. Wherever I traveled throughout the country, I learned how to give and how to love as I was welcomed in through the hospitality of others. The year was one of immense challenge, too. I struggled through my own linguistic incompetency in Wolof, the difficulty of being so far from home, trying to make sense of my role as a foreigner having been sent to learn the meaning of “service” (I quickly learned I was receiving so much more than I had any capacity to give), and immersing in Senegalese culture. These questions and challenges have stuck and remain central to who I am today. They have brought me to my present and future studies in Sociology, of feeling obligated to try and make sense of domestic and global wealth disparities. And my host-family members are some of those closest and most important to me in my life." Naomi Shifrin, Class of '21</p>

"I took French in high school, and for my 11th grade class we each took on personas from a francophone country. My teacher chose the country Senegal, and she gave presentations on Senegalese culture throughout the year which sparked my interest with the country. More generally speaking, exploring the African diaspora was a strong interest of mine as a black woman, and I hope that more black Princeton students can have a similar opportunity in the future." Lauren Johnson, Class of '21 </p>

"Everyone close to me in my life at home and in college knows that Senegal will hold a piece of my heart forever after 2018. A place I hadn't heard much about ended up becoming so incredibly meaningful and full of memories of warmth, love, and family. It's really family, what makes this country so important to me. Senegal is the place where some of my favorite people in the world live, where I have so many little siblings I adore, where I was shown levels of generosity, patience, and welcoming that I'd never really experienced before and are difficult to try to explain even now without becoming overwhelmed. Senegal was also a place where I could grow freely and experience communal life in ways that radically changed who I am and how I wish to interact with those around me. In the end, I know that I will always have a type of home in Senegal, a place that will welcome me back with open homes, countless greetings, and a warm plate of the most delicious rice in the world."

"I chose to go to Senegal because I felt that the location offered me the most learning opportunities possible. This is especially true given all of the identities that I hold (White, American, Man, English/French speaker, etc). I wasn't wrong. Senegal definitely offered many opportunities to learn and reflect on virtually everything I thought I knew in ways that were difficult at times, but undeniably beneficial. 

Now, my experiences from Senegal continue to help shape my worldview. I feel that my time in Senegal has made me much more ready to listen and accept new perspectives that I might never have considered before, which then allow me to grow and become more educated for both my own benefit as well as for the benefit of everyone around me. In short, Senegal forced me to grow as a person, so that I would then be prepared to grow more." John Bullock, Class of '23</p>

""How was Senegal?". Whenever people ask me this upon finding out that I did Bridge Year in Senegal, I usually summarize the vastness and complexity of my experiences in one word: "life-changing". I was challenged intellectually, emotionally, and physically in a variety of ways on any given day. From a 20 mile trek to taking public transportation to my service site, each day held new challenged that ultimately strengthened the person I truly was. But perhaps what made this experience most profound, were not the deep discussions on social inequality but rather the relationships I built with my homestay family and the people in the community in which I lived. Mareme Sow Diagne. This was the name of my homestay mother. She began my mom, my best friend, my sister, my confidant-- all in one. No, neither of us spoke the same language fluently, but our bond was unbreakable. We went did everything together from shopping for my birthday outfit to twisting our hair at night. I shared my emotional challenges in my broken Wolof, she gave me practical advice (that she'd have to repeat so that I could understand). We would cry together and laugh together during sleepovers and long rides back home. We got so close that it soon became impossible to imagine life without her. Words can't express the brokenness and confusion I felt upon later leaving my Senegalese family to return to my American one. Before Bridge Year, Senegal was just another country that still experienced the disabling effects of colonization despite its independence. It was another sad depiction of "broken, war-torn Africa". Leaving Senegal, it was now the home of my best friend. The issues I learned on an intellectual level became the social factors that emotionally impacted my mom-- they made her life more difficult. Going home, I knew Bridge Year wasn't over for me. I have a job to do, and that is I believe, to contribute to the fight of bridging the gap between the privileged and the powerless. I don't know exactly how it will happen but it is my calling. Before Senegal, social justice was important. After Senegal, social justice became my heart's cry." Nicole Williams, Class of '22</p>

"Choosing to spend 9 months in Senegal was undoubtedly the best decision I've ever made. Certainly, it was bold and brave, as is the decision of every other Bridge Year goer and adventure seeker. Frankly, I settled on Senegal after Googling the country and the results continued to discuss "teranga" or the sense of hospitality that the Senegalese people hold for all people. And it was precisely the continued sense of acceptance throughout my time in Senegal that gave way to the incredible experience of living there for 9 months. First and foremost, the family unit is the core of society in Senegal. Extended family members all live together and there is little distinction between cousins and siblings. With that, I was embraced as a full family member in my homestay family, the Mbaye family. I was loved as a daughter, sister, cousin, and niece. Despite the initial language barrier, my family's steadfast welcoming of me prevailed, often through smiling, laughing, and dancing - all universal languages. As my language skills developed, so did my relationships with my twenty-something family members and many others in the Yoff community. I felt like a full member of the Senegalese community. Senegal is amazing because the Senegalese people are amazing. As a student on Bridge Year, I am impressionable and curious, and Bridge Year Senegal offered me the perfect experience to explore the world and live and fully immerse in a rich culture entirely different from my own. I have carried home with me a sense of my own Senegalese nature. I try to greet everyone - barista and professor alike - before requesting something of them. Senegal brought out my best self, and my experience in Senegal reminded me to live with a continuously grateful heart. It's important to both recognize the wonderful gifts of life around you (people, land, food, language) and to voice your gratitude to others and/or God. I am immensely grateful for my experience on Bridge Year in Senegal and I am already itching to go back. I love Bridge Year." Sophia Singletary, Class of '23</p>

"I may have heard the name Senegal before considering a gap year there, but it was an empty name to me. The same could be said of many African countries - I knew very little of them. In spite of this ignorance, somehow Africa remained an incredibly meaning-heavy word. It loomed large in my imagination for so many reasons, most of them worn-out stereotypes and stark over-generalizations. To pierce through some of this mystical fog of representations that shrouded Africa was then a goal of mine - though at the time I was not aware just how much piercing there was to do. Certainly, I looked forward to the prospect of service-learning as a way to be engaged in the community, as well as the rich family life of which I had read. As I write, it may appear as though Senegal was always an obvious choice for me. That is only because there is no space to express all the uncertainties and rival considerations that one faces with such a big decision. Honestly, the decision in some part came down to a rather arbitrary factor: I adored (and still do love) the music of the great Senegalese musician Youssou Ndour.

It is difficult not to subconsciously impose what you got on what you expected. At the very least I would not have put my above reasons in quite the same language as I have now. By and large, though, I did get what I wanted, just not in the ways I expected. That gap was a difficult one. The biggest areas of learning were often not the glamorous ones that one might write on a CV: innovation, leadership, Microsoft Office. Instead, I got a crash course in underappreciated but precious qualities: humility, being quiet, reflection. Where I did learn skills that may be considered employable, it was not through such glorified means as I may have imagined. We may not look down on the idea of failure, recognizing it as the route to success, but it is not so easy to handle when you're not sure how far down the road success may be. Skills such as perseverance, cross-cultural communication, and endurance are certainly developed during Bridge Year, but most of us will remember our failures in these areas far more than the lessons that emerge. Ultimately, for all of the joys and wonders of my time in Senegal, in some way the space to fail was the most important thing. Senegal as a country is so dear to me for many reasons - I could list friends, places, sights, experiences, even some most fleeting of moments. But my time there was made distinct from the years before and after it mostly by the fact that it was a rare moment where failure had no penalty. We love the idea of freedom, and I will testify this strongly: young people must know the freedom to fail. How else will they be emboldened to take on the seemingly impossible challenges of our epoch?" Benjamin Roberts, Class of '22</p>
