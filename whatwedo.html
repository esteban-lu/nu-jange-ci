        <h2>Language Instruction</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p class = "w3-left-align">Weekly language instruction is one of the Novogratz Bridge Year Program’s cornerstones: it not only enables students to improve their language skills in a playful and collaborative setting but also provides important structure to the overall program. In two small groups of five, students will receive additional instruction in French based on their age and proficiency level prior to the program. The small group sizes and personal relationships between students and teachers allow for teaching methods catered to each student’s individual needs. <br><br>Whereas most students speak Wolof in their everyday lives, French, as Senegal’s official language, is used throughout the education system. The typical school system requires students to transition from speaking Wolof at home to exclusively speaking French in educational and professional settings. Good command of French, therefore, facilitates learning in all other disciplines. Moreover, fluency in French is a skill required in most professional settings. Many homes and parents do not speak fluent French, so resources for students outside of school are often limited. With the language learning program, participants will be empowered to succeed far beyond the classroom.

        <h2>Excursions</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p class = "w3-left-align">While formal instruction is an important part of the program, much of the learning we hope to facilitate is experiential - sometimes described as learning by “reflecting on doing” in a real-world context. Travelling is an excellent opportunity for experiential learning because it allows students to form lasting relationships as a group and to get to know their own country in a new way - many participants may have never left the Dakar peninsula before. Through two longer excursions (1 week or more) as well as several days- and weekend trips, students will discover the rich natural, historic, cultural, and linguistic heritage of Senegal’s diverse regions. Possible destinations include the old city of St. Louis in the North, the mountains of Kedougou in the Southeast, or the beautiful Sine-Saloum Delta in the Southwest. At each location, individual exploration will be accompanied by programming.  Programming will encourage students to engage with local issues and their connection to a global world; for example, the exploitation of natural resources or the role of tourism in Senegal’s future. Through their first-hand experiences, students will develop a critical awareness of the challenges faced by communities across Senegal (which might be very different from the challenges that students are aware of in Dakar) and gain leadership skills they will apply in their home communities and throughout their life.

        <h2>Guided  IAs</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p class = "w3-left-align">Busy school days, the limited availability of extracurricular activities and obligations at home sometimes leave little room for Yoff’s teenagers to deepen interests of their own. Independent Activities (IA) are an opportunity for program participants to pursue their own passions, either by cultivating a hobby they have had for years or by trying something completely new. The range of activities is therefore as diverse as the students, but subjects could include Djembe practice, traditional dance, photography, or an oral history project. Since we want students to have the opportunity to be creative in designing their activities, we will collaborate with external partners based on students’ ideas, e.g. to organize weekly dance classes or provide camera equipment. This approach facilitates greater student ownership of their learning and teaches students important project development skills. At the end of the program, students will be encouraged to present their activity to the program cohort and to pass on some of their knowledge.<br><br>Besides individual projects, Independent Activities will also involve sessions with the entire group. These will focus on practical skills relevant to the Yoff community that can easily be taught to larger groups, such as First Aid basics. Students will be encouraged to share these skills with their friends, siblings, and classmates, thereby positively impacting their local communities.

        <h2>Career Development/h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p class = "w3-left-align">Because Senegal’s economy is largely informal (meaning that most adults work full-time in unregulated or unofficial jobs), the transition from high school to the labor market or further education poses unique challenges to Senegalese teenagers. Furthermore, the rapidly growing population in Senegal is creating a demand for jobs that often cannot be met. Few centralized resources exist to allow students to gain insight into different professions or connect graduates with valuable opportunities; moreover, due to limited capacities available at local schools, students may lack important professional skills such as basic proficiency in common IT applications.<br><br>Utilizing networks across Dakar and access to a large pool of Bridge Year alumni, we aim to start filling this gap in several ways. A regular speaker series will invite professionals from diverse fields to talk about their work and career trajectories, culminating in a career fair for students to make connections and discover their passions. To better prepare students for their transitions to the professional world, local volunteers and Bridge Year alumni will offer additional workshops on specific skills, including English, public speaking, and online research.

        <h2>Community Service</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p class = "w3-left-align">Cultivating a life of service toward other human beings is one of the most important goals of this program, and it is more important now than ever to encourage this type of service in young people.  The program will emphasize service and will provide a variety of different opportunities to participants, based on student interest and on community need.  Participants can help mentor younger children, support community clean-ups, and organize advocacy projects.  We are also interested in partnering participants with the NGOs that the Novogratz Bridge Year students typically work with (such as Empire des Enfants and Ker Xaleyi), many of which would benefit from Senegalese volunteers (and will be lacking the Western volunteers who typically travel to work there).  Furthermore, the program will emphasize student leadership and creative problem-solving; Senegalese youth are positioned better than most to identify the most pressing needs within their communities.<p>

        <h2>Focus of Inquiry</h2>
      </header>
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p class = "w3-left-align">It is vitally important that Senegalese youth learn about their own cultural heritage.  Not only are the cultures of the Wolof group and of Yoff particularly vibrant, but Senegal is home to a multitude of ethnic groups and cultural practices.  Even students who are well-versed in their own community’s practices have likely been exposed less to those of other communities.  Increasing the awareness and knowledge of young people about their own culture is one of the best ways to promote advocacy, leadership, and peaceful coexistence.  This will also be highly tailored to students’ interests; each month can have a different cultural theme (the environment, religion, politics, etc.), and students can be in charge of leading topics that they are passionate about.  This encourages students to make connections within the community and helps to facilitate organizational skills.  The goal of cultural exploration is also closely linked to many of the other goals of the program: it can help expose students to different careers, and it provides another form of experiential learning.
