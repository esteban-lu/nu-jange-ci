<!-- Mission Statement -->
<div class = "w3-display-container w3-margin w3-center w3-padding-16 w3-opacity">
<h2>Mission Statement </h2>
<p class = "w3-medium">Nu Jange Ci: Intercultural Learning Mediation is an experiential-learning program for Senegalese youth in Yoff, Dakar run by Babacar Mbaye, a teacher for over twenty years at three different institutions, across the globe and across Senegal. The program is intended to empower students to “come together across identities, borders, prejudices, emotions, and histories to exercise compassion responsibly.”

<!-- Vision Statement -->
<div class = "w3-panel w3-margin w3-center w3-padding-16 w3-teal w3-opacity">
<h2> Our Vision </h2>
<p class = "w3-medium">We aim to support our dedicated teachers through a year for young Yoff community members, led by Babacar and focused on empowerment through experiential learning, civic engagement, and in-country travel.</p>
<p class = "w3-medium">The community of Yoff, Senegal, which has welcomed eight generations of Princeton Novogratz Bridge Year students, is a bastion of Senegalese hospitality, culture, and village life within the cosmopolitan capital of Dakar. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this community is now facing many challenges—in part because the Novogratz Bridge Year Program is paused for the upcoming year. Nu Jange Ci was founded on the ideas of an experienced teacher and Bridge Year Instructor Babacar Mbaye, with the support of a team of Alumni from across years and cohorts. As partners of the Yoff community who welcomed us with such care, we aim to take the opportunity presented by this year’s disruption to model what respectful and sustainable partnership in international education can look like. Babacar and all our dedicated instructors will work tirelessly to support each of their students in their development and well-being, as we provide experiential learning opportunities for career exploration, skill acquisition, in-country travel, academic support, and civic engagement in Senegal. Thank you for standing with us to support and empower young Yoff community members.</p>
