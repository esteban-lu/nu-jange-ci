There are times we find ourselves torn in between identities that are privileged and underprivileged, a victim and a perpetrator. Am I a man in this patriarchal society, a griot in Senegal, or a black man in this global society? I tell my students on Bridge Year, there are at least four answers to any question. And there are many identities in all of us humans. I am a father, a brother, a friend, a husband, a host, a guest, a threat, an ally. I embrace this complexity that forms me, a human being. <br><br> When I was offered my first official position as a teacher in a village, Ndioukhane, I cried. It was the beginning of ten years of great challenges and rewards, and of what has become twenty years as an educator in three different institutions. I entered my first teaching position the same way many recent university graduates did at the time: afraid that the right to education was being endangered and denied due to social and economic disadvantage. And determined to use my new influence to break down the barriers between my students and knowledge that I hoped would empower them. <br><br> Ten years later, when I interviewed to be an instructor at a flight school in Dakar, knowledge was not what my interviewers asked me about. Yes, my English was important, but what made the difference in my employment was my teamwork skills, and how well I could work under pressure. And I began to question, where had these skills come from? How do I teach them to my students? Not from a chalkboard, or the memorization of information.<br><br>My students in Bridge Year gain these skills through experiential learning. They travel, bake cakes, plan their own learning, sew dresses, lead soccer teams, follow their interests, and speak to people different from themselves. To see them become more capable and fully formed people is meaningful to me, but reminds me that I have an obligation to give their homestay siblings and community members in Yoff, Dakar the same opportunities. I am there whenever my Bridge Year students need me, and have been for eight years. I made the time to do so by turning down chances to play a bigger role in empowering the students who live in my own neighborhood. <br><br>I am coming to you because of my deep faith in the good achieved by humans coming together. The tasks at hand are too big for any one of us to achieve alone: we need the beauty and complexity of our diversity. We have to come together across identities, borders, prejudices, emotions, and histories to exercise compassion responsibly.  Bridge Year is impactful because it goes deeper than being purely transactional. Now that it is impossible for new students to participate and the transactions have ceased, what we have left are human connections and commitments to equity and diversity.<br><br>Let us support the community that has welcomed Bridge Year students by giving them a chance to discover their own community in ways only their Bridge Year siblings and friends have had the resources to. It has been a proud moment seeing my Bridge Year students embracing this goal, and I hope you do as well. And I hope that you are willing to come not only because you are both a conscious giver and receiver, but in recognizing that you are part of the problem and solution.<br><br><br>Babacar Mbaye
